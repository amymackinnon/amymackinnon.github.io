    <h2> How Does CUNY's Graduate School of Journalism Class of 2018 Stack Up?</h2>

<p> The 2016 presidential election prompted a  wave of soul-searching among
   American journalists, many of whom failed predict Donald Trump’s victory.
    <p> <aside class="pquote"><blockquote> “How did we and other news organizations underestimate the support for such
      an unusual, even divisive candidate?” - Dean Baquet, Executive Editor of the New York Times in a note to all staff</blockquote>   </aside></p>

<p> Trump's victory was <a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/11/09/behind-trumps-victory-divisions-by-race-gender-education/">underpinned</a> by the support of rural voters
  and whites without college degrees and revealed a gulf in American society that
   ran deeper than previously thought. College Admissions Directors <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2017/09/13/the-trump-effect-in-college-admissions-rural-outreach-increases-international-recruitment-gets-harder/?utm_term=.1493af75e0c4">stepped up</a>
   their rural outreach efforts and in the media there were calls for greater
    coverage of the American heartland. </p>

<p>“As The Times begins a period of self-reflection, I hope its editors will
  think hard about the half of America the paper too seldom covers,” wrote the
   Times’ Public Editor Liz Spayd.</p>

<p>The CUNY Graduate School of Journalism’s class of 2018 is the first cohort
   to join the school during the Trump presidency. How is rural America reflected among this upcoming generation of American journalists?</p>

<p> Of the 84 US Citizens on the program, 83 are from counties which were classified as urban in the 2010 US census. Data for 45 of the students
  was obtained by a Google Poll which asked, "Which town and country did you reside in for the longest period between the ages of 12 and 20". Research suggests that experiences and learning from this period play a fundamental role in political socialization.
  The rest of data set was supplemented with the self-declared hometowns of students listed on the school's face book.
